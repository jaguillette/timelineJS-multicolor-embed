# Timeline JS with multi-color groups

This repository powers a GitHub pages site whose sole purpose is to render [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com) timelines (as created by the fabulous folks at the [Knight Lab at Northwestern University](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/)), but with multiple colors in the tracks representing different groups in the timeline. It doesn't have the same options for changing configuration that the main Timeline JS embed tool has, so you only get the one display, but it will read from any viable Google Sheet set up for Timeline JS.
